# AJP Time Delay Device Documentation

Supplemental material for article on a programmable electronic delay circuit.

- `assembly-instructions`: A guide to ordering parts and building the device
  yourself.

- `arduino/FIFO_P`: The code uploaded to the Arduino Due.

- `fifo-p3f`: The KiCAD files for the device, as well as a schematic
  PDF and the gerber files that I sent for manufacture.

- `program-rescaling`: The code used to calculate the gain and offset
  resistor values to be optimal, given the constraints of E-series
  values and the overall resistances needed.
