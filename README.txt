Time Delay Device Documentation
===============================

See `./doc/doc-all.pdf`. It's header is reproduced below.

All of the documentation concerning the auxilliary files for the project
is assembled here. What follows is a description of the contents of each
directory.

-   `arduino`: The code uploaded to the Arduino Due.

-   `doc`: The top-level documentation directory (this one).

-   `fifo-p3f`: The KiCAD files for the device, as well as a schematic
    <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">pdf</span> and the gerber
    files that I sent for manufacture.

-   `program-rescaling`: The code used to calculate the gain and offset
    resistor values to be optimal, given the constraints of E-series
    values and the overall resistances needed.
